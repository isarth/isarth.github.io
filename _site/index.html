	<p>Hi I'm Sarthak</p>
  <p align="left">Iâ€™m currently a final year student at NSIT and have been working as a research intern at MIDAS Lab, IIITD for about 8 months.My research interest is mainly in NLP and computation linguistics<br /><br />

During my time as a research intern, I worked under Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah (IIITD) and  Dr. Debanjan Mahata ( Bloomberg LP ) on text summarization using custom Text rank and was able to improve over the results in the original paper. The entire project is written over a pre-existing python library and I was also able to find and fix a bug the library. Recently, I participated in the SemEval challenge suggestion mining task ( Link ) from product reviews and was ranked 10th out of 34 teams. I wrote the entire models in pytorch. And other projects as a team member.<br /><br />

And currently, I am working on my final year thesis on domain independent suggestions mining, where training and test data are from a different domain.
